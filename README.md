# blobDB: A Distributed File Database
blobDB is a high-performance, distributed file database implemented in C++. It leverages the Nodepp framework to achieve asynchronous operations and non-blocking I/O, making it ideal for scalable and responsive data storage solutions.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Distributed Architecture:** Designed for horizontal scalability and resilience across multiple nodes.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Built on Nodepp, ensuring non-blocking I/O for efficient resource utilization.
- **High Performance:** Optimized C++ implementation for fast file storage and retrieval.
- **File-Based Storage:** Manages and stores files as blobs across the distributed system.
- **Robust & Scalable:** Capable of handling large volumes of data and concurrent requests.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **C++:** The core programming language for blobDB.
- **Nodepp:** An asynchronous, non-blocking I/O framework for C++, providing the event-driven architecture.
